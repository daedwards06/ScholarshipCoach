He is best known for his distinguished career as the President and CEO of Duro Bag Manufacturing, the world\u2019s largest paper bag manufacturing company, and his unwavering commitment to epilepsy research through the Charles L. Shor Foundation for Epilepsy Research.</p>\n<p>Throughout his life, Charles has battled epilepsy. After a harrowing kidnapping attempt and his appointment as the President of Duro Bag, his seizures intensified. His determination to rise above this challenge led him to establish the Charles L. Shor Foundation for Epilepsy Research in 2002. To date, the foundation has generously donated over $1 million to various institutions, including the University of Cincinnati, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Cincinnati, making it one of Ohio\u2019s premier private foundations.</p>\n<p>We spoke with Tanya Fleming of Epilepsy Wellness Advocates and the CLS Foundation about the foundation&#8217;s charitable work and the new scholarship program.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholarship America: Could you start by telling us about your role at the CLS Foundation and what inspired the CLS Foundation to partner with Scholarship America for your scholarship initiatives?</strong></p>\n<p>CLS: At the Charles L. Shor Foundation, my role as the day-to-day executive is to ensure that our philanthropy is structured to remove barriers and create durable opportunity\u2014especially for individuals and families navigating epilepsy.</p>\n<p>This scholarship initiative was inspired by a reality we see too often: people with epilepsy are fully capable of pursuing lives of purpose and independence, but traditional educational pathways are not designed with their needs in mind. Health uncertainty, financial strain, caregiver burden, and inconsistent support systems can stand in the way long before ability or ambition ever does.</p>\n<p>We partnered with Scholarship America because we wanted this program to be executed with the highest level of rigor and trust. Their expertise allows us to deliver scholarships in a way that is scalable, transparent, and centered on student success\u2014while we stay focused on the deeper mission of wellness, independence, and long-term outcomes for people with epilepsy.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholarship America: How do you see this partnership with Scholarship America enhancing and complementing your existing student support programs?</strong></p>\n<p>CLS: This partnership allows us to do more than provide financial assistance, it allows us to build a true support structure around the student.\u00a0 For people with epilepsy, the barriers are rarely just tuition. The challenge is often the surrounding burden: medical complexity, caregiver strain, interruptions in schooling, and the lack of systems that understand what students are managing day to day.\u00a0 Scholarship America strengthens our ability to deliver this program with operational excellence, but more importantly, it helps us create the foundation for supports adjacent to the scholarship\u2014so that we maximize the probability of persistence, completion, and long-term success. Our goal is not simply access. Our goal is strong and sustainable outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholarship America: Beyond scholarships, the CLS Foundation also works on epilepsy wellness resources and economic research through programs like Epilepsy Wellness Advocates and the Blue-Collar Dollar Institute. How does educational access tie into those broader goals?</strong></p>\n<p>CLS: Educational access is one of the most powerful levers we have to improve quality of life for people with epilepsy.\u00a0 Epilepsy impacts far more than health\u2014it affects employment, independence, confidence, and the ability to plan for the future. When educational pathways become inaccessible, it compounds caregiver burden and limits long-term opportunity.\u00a0 Our scholarship work is directly tied to our broader wellness goals because we want both the individual with epilepsy and their caregivers to have more stability, more support, and a clearer path forward\u2014so they can focus on care management and living with purpose.\u00a0 We place particular emphasis on skilled trades and career-focused education because these pathways often require less time commitment, reduce student debt, and lead to strong long-term outcomes. That combination is especially important for students managing a chronic neurological condition.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-45147\" src=\"https://scholarshipamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Shor-Cincy-Enq-Sized.jpg\" alt=\"Provided portrait of American businessman Charles L Shor by The Enquirer/ Amanda Rossmann\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://scholarshipamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Shor-Cincy-Enq-Sized.jpg 1920w, https://scholarshipamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Shor-Cincy-Enq-Sized-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Scholarship America: Many organizations use scholarships as a way to extend impact beyond direct services. How does this initiative complement your advocacy and research work?</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>CLS: This initiative is a natural extension of our advocacy and wellness mission.\u00a0 Direct services matter, but long-term impact comes from removing systemic barriers that keep people with epilepsy from fully participating in society\u2014economically, professionally, and personally.\u00a0 Scholarships are one of the clearest ways to extend that impact because they invest in independence. They reduce financial pressure, alleviate caregiver burden, and open pathways to meaningful work.\u00a0 And by pairing scholarship support with adjacent resources, we are not just funding education\u2014we are increasing the likelihood of completion, career success, and long-term quality of life.\u00a0 Ultimately, this scholarship is about more than education. It\u2019s about enabling people with epilepsy to pursue lives defined not by limitation, but by purpose and opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholarship America: What impact do you hope this scholarship program will have on students\u2019 lives over the long term, particularly in reducing barriers for people balancing health challenges with education or career growth?</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>CLS: We need to give all Americans the opportunity to have the success I did, no matter if you have any illness.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholarship America: What\u2019s your number one piece of advice for students considering applying?</strong></p>\n<p>CLS: Work hard. Don\u2019t accept no. Understand we only use 1/7 of our brain power, so just trying will allow you to learn you can do whatever you put your mind to.</p>\n", "builder_wysiwyg_heading": "", "builder_wysiwyg_subheading": ""}, {"acf_fc_layout": "hubspot_form", "hubspot_form_description": "<p>Our Scholarship Design team can help you create and administer a scholarship for students in your community.
