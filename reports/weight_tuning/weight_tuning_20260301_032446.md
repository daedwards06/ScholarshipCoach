## Notes

- Proxy relevance labels are heuristic labels from the existing golden harness, not human judgments.
- Evaluation uses a saved parquet snapshot only; this experiment never triggers live ingest.
- The selection objective is deterministic: NDCG@K, then coverage@K, then sponsor diversity@K, then lower amount-dominance penalty, then config ID.
- Next steps: inspect per-profile top-K IDs in the JSON artifact before promoting weights broadly.
